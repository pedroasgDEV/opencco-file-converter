This project is a Python-based tool that converts `.xml` files generated by the [OpenCCO project](https://github.com/OpenCCO-team/OpenCCO) into both `.txt` and `.vtk` formats.

## Features

- Convert OpenCCO `.xml` files to `.txt` and `.vtk` formats.
- Supports optional output paths for `.txt` and `.vtk` files.
- Simple command-line interface (CLI) with built-in help.

## Requirements

Before using the tool, make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedroasgDEV/opencco-file-converter
cd opencco-file-converter
```

### 2. Build the Executable

Run the following command to automatically create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and build the executable:

```bash
make
```

This command will:

- Create a virtual environment inside the `opencco-file-converter/` folder.
- Install all required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Build the standalone executable `opencco-file-converter` in the `opencco-file-converter/` folder.
- Clean up any temporary files generated during the build process

## Usage

After building the executable, you can use the following command to run the tool:

```bash
./opencco-file-converter input.xml --txt output.txt --vtk output.vtk
```

### Arguments

- **`input` (required)**: Path to the `.xml` file generated by the OpenCCO project.
- **`--txt` (optional)**: Path to save the `.txt` output file. If not provided, a default file `./output.txt` will be used.
- **`--vtk` (optional)**: Path to save the `.vtk` output file. If not provided, a default file `./output.vtk` will be used.

## Error Handling

The program includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:

- **Missing or incorrect input file**: The `.xml` file path is required.
- **Invalid file extensions**: Ensure that the `.xml` input file, `.txt` output file, and `.vtk` output file have the correct extensions.
- **File not found**: The specified file(s) must exist on the system.
